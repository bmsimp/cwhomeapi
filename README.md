# ConnectWise Home API

This will be a community created API document for ConnectWise Home until such time as ConnectWise releases a supported API. Thanks goes to John Duprey for figuring out how to get [authentication setup with Rewst](https://github.com/JohnDuprey/RewstWorkflows/tree/main/CWHome).

### Note
There are several endpoints on here that require additional scopes. They will fail as unauthorized until you add them. This is especially true for the home.connectwise.com server endpoints.

### Note
If you are a Rewst user, this will not import correctly for custom integrations v2. This is due to their currently defined process of only having a single server for the hostname.
